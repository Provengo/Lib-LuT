= Lookup Table Library
_Provengo Core Team_

A library for defining lookup tables to your Provengo models.

Lookup tables are a popular way of creating when/then tests, such as:

> When `product` is "car" and `customer_type` is "person", then `handling_department` should be "individuals".

This library also allows to definition of ranges of values, as well as generation of test cases based on table rows.

== Example

Consider the test case of a recommendation system for products, based on customer properties.

[cols="1,1,1,1"]
|===
| (in) Age | (in) Hobby | (out) Item | (out) Color

| 0 | n/a | plush toy | light green

| 1-10 | cars | toy car | red 

| 1-10 | animals | frog doll | green

| 18-24 | travel | backpack | blue

| (all) | beige | bicycle | beige

| (all) | (all) | bicycle | white

|===

based on the above table, we expect the system to offer a frog doll when asked to recommend a product for a 7-year old who likes animals, a toy car for a similar kid who likes cars, and a white bicycle for a 13 year old.

The above table is captured in code like so:

[source, javascript]
----
const myLut = LUT.create({   <.>
    name: "Recommendations",
     ins: ["age","hobby"],
    outs: ["item","color"]
});

myLut.addRow({ ins:[0, LUT.ANY                  ], outs:["plush toy", "light green" ]});  <.>
myLut.addRow({ ins:[LUT.Range(1,10),  "cars"    ], outs:["toy car",   "red"         ]});
myLut.addRow({ ins:[LUT.Range(1,10),  "animals" ], outs:["frog doll", "green"       ]});
myLut.addRow({ ins:[LUT.Range(18,24), "travel"  ], outs:["backpack",  "blue"        ]});
myLut.addRow({ ins:[LUT.ANY,          "beige"   ], outs:["bicycle",   "beige"       ]});

myLut.addRow({                            <.>
    ins:{age:LUT.ANY, hobby:"beige"},   
    outs:["bicycle", "white"]
});
myLut.addRow({
    ins:[LUT.ANY, LUT.ANY],
    outs:{item:"bicycle", color:"white"}
});

let useCase = request(myLut.generateLutEvents());  <.>
let expected = myLut.lookup(useCase.data.ins);     <.>
